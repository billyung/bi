For table compare to work (and its used when testing full reload vs incremental ETL) 
then kff-plugins4.jar has to be put in the pdi directory plugins/steps 


Table compare uses 2 jndi settings DB1 and DB2

Output goes to the $PDI_HOME directory (data-integration)
Summary output -> ComparisonStatistics.txt
Error output -> ComparisonErrorDetails.txt

Job currently compares data warehouse databases but could be for any db 
by changing step "Get DW Table Names" in CompareDatabaseTables.ktr

Quick when no errors... much slower when loads of errors.
