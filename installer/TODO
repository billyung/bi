[_] we may need two install dirs, one for Pentaho BI Server (reports) and one for Pentaho Data Integration (ETL jobs)
[_] rename final jar to "mifosbi-1.0-beta-install.jar" or something like that
[_] default install path to "/tmp/blah" or something besides "${user.home}/Mifos BI Software". This will eventually be somewhere in the pentaho installation dir
[_] test db connection
[_] install jars for Tally, XBRL stuff
[_] initialize data warehouse database
[_] schedule ETL jobs
[_] how will upgrading an existing installation work?
[_] bounce Pentaho server? or maybe just refresh resources? (whatever is necessary so installed files can be used)
[_] verify Pentaho BI Server is installed and is the correct version
[_] verify Pentaho Data Integration is installed and is the correct version
[_] include version info similar to what is used on the Mifos sys info page
