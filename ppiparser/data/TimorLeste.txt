Use an additional sheet if there are more than 12 household members.  


 
Record the total number of household members under “household size” at the top of the scorecard 
 
Mark scorecard Question 2 based on the number of household members 17-years-old or younger 
 
Mark scorecard Question 3 based on whether all household members ages 8 to 17 attend school 
 
Mark scorecard Question 4 based on whether any household member’s main occupation was a wage or non-wage, 
non-farming job 


 
Household members are defined as the people who normally live in the same house and eat from the same pot (that is, 
they have a common arrangement for food, such as using a common kitchen or a common food budget), including young 
children, newborns, old people, sick people, people who are temporarily absent, domestic employees (inside doors), and 
relatives, pensioners, and guests. The persons may be related to each other or may be non-relatives, including servants or 
employees who stay with the employer. The field agent should make a complete list of all the people who normally live 
and eat their meals together in this dwelling. All people who currently live in the residence are counted as members. 
People who normally live in the residence but who are currently absent are also counted as members if the total length of 
their absence (counting both actual past absence and expected future absence) is six months or less. Newborns, 
newlyweds, and people who recently joined the household permanently are counted as members even though their past 
absence may have exceeded six months. Please consult the Interpretation of Indicators document for further details and 
definitions.
