Use an additional sheet if there are more than 12 household members. 

 

 Record the total number of household members under “household size” at the top of the scorecard 
 Mark scorecard Question 1 based on the total number of household members 
 Mark scorecard Question 2 based on school attendance by household members ages 6 to 18 


 

A household is a person or people, related or unrelated, who live together, who acknowledge a head of household, and 
who ate their meals together for at least 6 of the last 12 months. Infants, newlyweds, and others present for less than six 
months are household members if they expect to remain. So are students and seasonal workers who have not been living 
in another household. Servants and farm workers are members if they live and eat there. People who live in the same 
dwelling, but who do not share food expenses or eat meals together, are not members. Visitors are not members. 
Polygamous marriages are separate households if each wife and her children live and eat separately. 

 

Currently attending school refers to primary, secondary, vocational/technical, or professional school. Students are counted 
as currently attending if they are not attending because they are on holiday, on vacation, studying for exams, or if school 
is temporarily closed. Government, private, NGO/religious, or boarding refers to who manages the school. “Day and 
boarding” counts as “Boarding”. 

 

Please consult the “Interview Guide” and “Guidelines for the Interpretation of Scorecard Indicators” for further details 
and definitions.
