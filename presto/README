Pentaho Report Test Framework - "presto"

QUICK START:
    install.py will help you make sure you are ready to run tests. Run that
    first. It will report diagnostics on your dev environment and tell you how
    to run the tests.

how to compile code and run tests:
  * execute "gradle build"

how to write tests:
  * see writing_tests.txt

how to develop presto with an IDE
  * Eclipse: "gradle eclipse"
  * IntelliJ Idea: "gradle idea"

prereqs for running tests:
  * Gradle
  * PDI 4.1.0 w/Reporting Output Step installed
  * set up PDI db connection params

prereqs for test development:
  * Eclipse with Groovy plugin (optional)
  * Python (to run install.py)

conventions:
  * indent all source code with 4 spaces, no tabs
  * don't commit IDE settings (exception: .settings/ dir for Eclipse since, for
    instance, it enforces the use of spaces instead of tabs)
