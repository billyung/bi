Configuration:

* ~/.presto
  * baseDir - convenience so, in your tests, you need only mention part of the
    path to .prpt files
  * pdiHome - full/absolute path to Pentaho Data Integration installation

Coding:

* See ExamplePrptReportTest.groovy

* PrptReport.execute() takes a reportPath, and a closure of tests to perform on
  the output of the report under test.

* all tests use 1-based indices

* if baseDir is set in your config, reportFilename is relative to baseDir
  otherwise, reportFilename is assumed to be the full (relative or absolute) path
